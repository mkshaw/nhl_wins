# Predict NHL Wins

This code details different machine learning approaches to predicting winners in NHL games:

- Logistic regression
- Single classification tree
- Bagging
- Random forest
- Boosting
- Support vector classifier
- Support vector machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel
- SVM with radial kernel

It uses data from the 2012-13 NHL season for training, particularly that used by [Weissbock et al. (2013)](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~diana/publications/ECML_PKDD___2013.pdf), and the 2021-22 season for testing. Logistic regression performed the best, with an AUC of .64.
